# LeetCode-Solutions
A place to store LeetCode solutions to help track my progress and consistency. This repo is focused on learning all the LC patterns/tricks. Nearly all the problems on LC can be solved by knowing about 14 different patterns. Multiple questions are solved with the same patterns. 

*Solutions are done in Python because Python is by far the best interview language since it is less wordy than other languages. for example, in Java to make a hashmap you need
    Map<String, String> myMap  = new HashMap<String, String>()
    
    Python...
    myMap = {} 
    As you can see, it saves a lot of time knowing python.
    

# BFS...
In BFS, we start by pushing the root node into a queue. Then, we remove an element(node) from the front of the queue. For every node removed from the queue, we add all its children to the back of the same queue. We keep on continuing this process till the queue becomes empty. In this way, we can traverse the given tree on a level-by-level basis.
If you look at my solutions under the BFS folder, you will see that each problem has an identical solution. Depending on the question asked, only slight modifications were needed.
